On the 30th of March, 2023, TAC Africa joined the rest of the world to observe the UN International Day of Zero Waste. The United Nations General Assembly on 14 December 2022 formally recognized the importance of zero-waste initiatives and proclaimed 30 March as the International Day of Zero Waste, to be observed annually beginning in 2023.
The program began with the arrival of the guests who were then accredited. This was followed by a tea break to get the guests prepared for the road walk that followed thereafter. With the use of placards and handheld banners, the throng marched across the railway corridors. The placards bore bold inscriptions such as “Zero Waste Initiatives”, “Towards a Safer and Cleaner Railway Corridors”, “Save the Railway Communities” etc.
After an hour of walking around the railway corridors and sensitizing the community on the need to save the Railway Corridors by desisting from depositing refuse around the railway corridors, the crowd marched back to the TAC Community Hub for the remaining activities for the day.

The Chief Executive Offi­cer/Founder of Technology Against Crime in Africa (TAC Africa) Dr.Jerry Akubo, a very articulate Security expert and Consultant delivered the Keynote lecture, he urged everyone present to take responsibility because the environment is ours and it belongs to everyone living around these communities to ensure that we resist indiscriminate dumping of refuse around the railway corridors and ultimately for a cleaner and safer Nigeria.
The Managing Director of Mr Tidy Nigeria, Mr Olisa Ogbechie gave his speech from an environmental perspective. He emphasized that one of the biggest menaces plaguing our communities today especially the railway corridors is the nuisance from indiscriminate dumping of refuse.

He further said that zero waste is an approach aimed at redefining the way societies consume, produce and dispose materials. At its core, zero waste seeks to establish a sustainable, circular system that prioritizes resource conservation, waste prevention and the responsible management of materials.

This strategy involves designing products for durability and resource effi­ciency, promoting resource recovery, and eliminating harmful waste disposal methods such as incineration, dumping, and landfilling. 

The special consultant to TAC Africa, Miss Oyeh Ugonma also gave her speech from a social perspective. 
During the event, there were deliberations which were very informative and insightful, with its outcome expected to have far-reaching benefits in compliance with the Zero Waste Campaign. In finality, as we confront the growing waste crisis, it is increasingly evident that a zero waste approach is crucial in promoting responsible production and consumption patterns and advancing towards a sustainable, circular system.
